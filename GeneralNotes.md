# General notes 

* [ProbAI Summer School](https://probabilistic.ai/self-study/)

## Ideas

* Think I could re-frame the problem uisng simulation based inference - seems to be a speciifc framework for understanding paramter estimation problems.  (Lecture9)
* Could give a journal club on Bayesian workflow (Lecture 3)
* Could I look at using an autoencoder as a way to find latent variables/ importance in the dataset? /principal component analysis.
